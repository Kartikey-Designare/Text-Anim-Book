# Setting up

Text animations at its core is just some GSAP animations paired with small plugins and sometimes even solely.

We will install 'gsap' and '@gsap/react' as our core libraries for using these animation on react or react based frameworks.

```term copy
npm i gsap @gsap/react
```

In the latest version of GSAP, we don't need to do manual cleanup of animations, the new react hook 'useGSAP' handles all contexting and cleanup functions for us.

```js copy
import gsap from 'gsap'
import { useGSAP } from '@gsap/react';
```
